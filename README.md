 This repository contains the 2D Roguelike Scavengers tutorial project. I followed along the videos and uploaded
 the completed game to GitHub. The game is designed to run in Unity 5.0 and contains the capability of use on 
 an iOS platform. Switch the build settings to iPhone/iPad to test, will need some other method of running as 
 Unity does not appear to be capable of emulating an iPhone. There is also a built version of the game under 
 builds labeled Scavengers PC for quick testing purposes should you not have Unity set up.
